                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>1</h2>
                    <p>Lightly grease a large bowl with cooking spray. In another large bowl or in the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, stir milk and yeast until yeast is mostly dissolved. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>2</h2>
                    <p>Add eggs, flour, granulated sugar, butter, salt, and baking soda and beat on low speed until combined. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until dough is smooth and elastic and starts to pull away from sides of bowl, 10 to 15 minutes. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>3</h2>
                    <p>Transfer dough to prepared bowl and turn so outside of dough is thoroughly greased. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise until almost doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.</p>

                <h3>ASSEMBLY</h3>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>1</h2>
                    <p>In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer, or in the large bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, cream brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/2 cup butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Lightly grease a 13"x 9" baking pan with butter.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>2</h2>
                    <p>On a lightly floured surface, dust dough with more flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a large square (about 18"x 18"). Spread to edges with filling, then roll dough into a log. Using a sharp knife, cut into 12 pieces, each about 1 1/2" wide.</p>

                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>3</h2>
                    <p>Arrange rolls cut side up in prepared pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>4</h2>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 400°. Uncover rolls and bake until golden brown, 20 to 22 minutes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>5</h2>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in large bowl using handheld mixer or in the large bowl of stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and remaining 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt until light and fluffy. Gradually add milk and continue to beat to loosen icing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h2>6</h2>
