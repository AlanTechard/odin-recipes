    <h2>Cooking Time!</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Cake</strong></p>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease a 13"-x-9" baking pan with cooking spray. Prepare cake according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Using a bamboo skewer or chopstick, poke holes all over cake, making sure not to go through to the bottom and spacing 1/2" to 1" apart.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil. Add Jell-O powder; whisk until dissolved. Remove from heat and whisk in 1/2 cup cold water.</li>
        <li>Pour gelatin mixture evenly over holes on cake. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Frosting</strong></p>
        <li>In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer, beat cream on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, using handheld mixer, beat cream cheese on medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy. Add confectioners' sugar and beat until smooth, then add in vanilla and salt. Fold in whipped cream until just combined.</li>
        <li>Spread frosting over top of cake; reserve remaining frosting for topping (optional).</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Toping</strong></p>
        <li>In a food processor, pulse cookies to pea-sized crumbs. Transfer to a medium bowl. Pour butter over crumbs, sprinkle with Jell-O powder, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle crumb mixture over frosting, then lightly press down on crumbs to adhere.</li>
        <li>Dollop or pipe reserved frosting over crumbs (if using). Top dollops with strawberries.</li>
